    <p>And now for some filler text...</p>
    <p>We chose to go to the moon this decade and do other things, not becauae they are
    easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the
    best of our energies and skills, because the challenge is something we are willing to accept,
    one we are unwilling to postpone, one in which we intend to win</p><br>
    <p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds or perpahs thousands
    more who will, the experience most certianly changes your perspective. The things
    that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which devide us.</p>
